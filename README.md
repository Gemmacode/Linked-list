# Linked-list

This project focuses on assessing one's grasp of data organization, structuring, and access. Within this repository, I have re-implemented generic classes for the following data structures:

- Singly Linked List
- Stack
- Queue

These implementations serve as a practical demonstration of my understanding of these fundamental data structures and their associated operations.
